# S.W.A.T BETA Globe 
### Summary
This was created in order to visualize all of the machines currently undergoing beta testing around the world. This is hosted on our internal website for SWAT.

### Data
Each machine is linked into a project sheet with general data related to the project
- location
- machine type
- number of hours
- point of contacts
- etc

### Future
This project was initiated as a preliminary assessment to understand the expectations involved in compiling final beta reports. Additionally, it serves as a concise visual representation of all current beta projects under the purview of SWAT. We plan on continuing to develop this on our free time in order to polish up any remaining features.
